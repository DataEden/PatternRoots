# PatternRoots
### **🌍 A multi-language pattern matching lab rooted in regex logic — Python, Java, YAML &amp; more.**
### **🌱 Part of the DataEden ecosystem — exploring patterns in nature, data, and code.**

### **🌿 PatternRoots – A Cross-Language Pattern Matching Playground "Where code meets nature and patterns take root."**

PatternRoots is a language-agnostic, multi-environment repository for building and experimenting with regular expressions and pattern-matching logic across Python, Java, YAML, and more.

This is more than a regex sandbox — it’s a garden of pattern-driven microprojects, utilities, and learning tools built with:

🧩 Language-diverse code snippets and utilities (Python, Java, YAML, etc.)

🧪 Test cases and validation strategies for each environment

🧵 Pattern matching in structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data

📄 Tutorials, README breakdowns, and project board tracking

Whether you’re parsing JSON, scanning logs, building form validators, or scraping structured content — **PatternRoots** lets you cultivate strong cross-language regex roots, one project at a time.
