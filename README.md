# 🌿 PatternRoots

### 🧠 A Cross-Language Pattern Matching Playground
**"Where code meets nature and patterns take root."**

---

### 🌍 A multi-language regex + pattern-matching lab rooted in logic, abstraction, and real-world data.
### 🌱 Part of the DataEden ecosystem — exploring patterns in nature, data, and code.

---

**PatternRoots** is a language-agnostic, multi-environment repository for developing, testing, and sharing regular expression projects and broader pattern-matching workflows. Designed for developers, data scientists, and curious learners, this space grows regex-powered microprojects across Python, Java, YAML, and beyond.

This isn't just a regex sandbox — it’s a 🌱 _garden of pattern-rich experimentation_ with full tooling support and intentional learning pathways.

---

## 🔧 Features

- 🧩 **Language-Diverse Projects**  
  Modular pattern-matchers in Python, Java, YAML, Bash, and other ecosystems.

- 🧪 **Test-Driven Exploration**  
  Includes unit tests (e.g., Python `unittest`, Java `JUnit`) to verify logic and encourage validation best practices.

- 🧵 **Multi-Format Matching**  
  Patterns for structured (JSON, CSV), semi-structured (HTML, XML), and unstructured (text logs, documents) formats.

- 📁 **Well-Organized Project Tree**  
  Each module is scoped and named for discoverability: `scrapers/`, `validators/`, `filters/`, and more.

- 📄 **Documentation and Learning Resources**  
  Every major component includes a README, examples, usage notes, and learning links.

- 📊 **Project Board + Contribution Tracker**  
  GitHub Project Board integration for roadmap planning, milestone tracking, and collaborative goals.

## 🌐 Use Cases

PatternRoots is perfect for:

- 🔍 Scraping structured data from noisy web content
- 🗃 Filtering logs, error traces, or messages
- 🧾 Validating input (e.g., emails, phone numbers, IDs)
- 🔡 Parsing strings into categories
- 🎓 Studying cross-language syntax of regex implementations
- 💡 Prototyping pattern-based ideas for data science or engineering workflows

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repo**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/PatternRoots.git
```

2. **Set Up Your Language Environment**:
- For Python: `python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate`
- For Java: Compile with `javac`, run with `java`

3. **Explore Folders**:
- `python/` — Python regex utilities and projects
- `java/` — Java-based pattern matchers
- `yaml/` — Pattern configurations and validation rules

4. **Run Tests**:
- Python: `python -m unittest discover`
- Java: via JUnit or IDE test runner

5. **Start Your Own Pattern Project!**
